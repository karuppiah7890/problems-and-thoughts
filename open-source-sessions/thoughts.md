# Open Source Sessions

This refers to sessions around Open Source. I was planning to do some sessions
for folks new to Open Source, so that we can smoothly blend into the
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitialocean.com) event for this year, 2020.
And I'm noting down the thoughts I have and I need to create a plan based on
that.

---

What is Open Source? What's the opposite? Open Source Licenses. Copyleft.

Why Open Source? Why does it exist? Why do people contribute to Open Source?

How Open Source? How do people contribute to open source? Do people earn money
from Open Source? How do people earn money? Different Open Source Models. 
Support from Individuals and Companies/Donations. Open Core along with
Enterprise Edition. Enterprise Support with Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
Custom Solutions for Enterprises.

Time management. The mantra to do anything and everything.

What to contribute to? Find what you like. It's easier to hold on to, for a
long time. If you are looking for a long run. Also, understand the why.
Understand why you wanna contribute. Understand the benefits of contributing.
Both could be related, but it's not necessary that it has to be related. For
example, you could be contributing to Open Source just for the fun of it,
because some tool looks cool and it has challenging problems. But the benefits
will be, you learning tons of stuff. And also enjoying of course, because you
like what you are doing. I wouldn't really recommend doing something that you
don't like doing. No one has time for that. Choose what you like to do, or
experiment and do it :)

The mantra I chose - build tools that I wanted to hack and try. Build tools
simply because I wanted to create an open source alternative because I didn't
find one. I should probably have dug in better. Usually there are always some
open source alternatives.

I also contributed to tools that I used or found interesting. I used them a bit,
checked issues. Tried to contribute.

One of the mantras in the repository that I most contributed to was - reproduce
issue, confirm issue, find root cause, write failing test for the issue, fix the issue

Another benefit of contributing Open Source is - you hone your skills in the
process. There are different kinds of skills that you get! It depends on the
kind of contribution.

What does it mean to contribute to Open Source? Contributing Code, docs, triaging
issues, reviewing pull requests, answering queries and solving issues in
online communities related to the Open Source software - stack overflow,
discourse, gitter, slack, discord and offline ones - conferences, meetups;
giving talks in conferences, meetups; writing blog posts about Open Source or
Open Source software; doing videos abut Open Source or Open Source software 
on YouTube, Vimeo etc; doing sessions / workshops on Open Source or Open Source
software, for example this one ;) Helping others contribute to Open Source;
running events/meetups/conferences related to Open Source; The list goes on.
If you do Anything related to Open Source, it's called Contributing to Open
Source.
