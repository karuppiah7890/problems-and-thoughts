# Docs and PDF stuff

Today I was trying to view a doc file and I had a hard time using Mac Pages to read it
or even Google Docs. The doc was full of images. And the images were overlapping each
other, and it was really hard to read the doc. I tried to edit, but moving a single
image moved other images too somehow and it got more clumsy when I tried to clean it up.
Finally I created a blank google doc and tried to copy paste images and still found the
same issue happening. It was something related to positioning. Finally I realized that
the images were having this property that said "wrap text" and I changed that to "in line"
and the images didn't overlap or have positioning issues. I guess it was in some floating
mode or something. 

One learning from this bad experience is - when you want someone to simply view some doc,
share that doc in the form of PDF. Almost everything can be converted to PDFs these days -
docs, spreadsheets, presentations and what not. 

Share the source doc as is when you want the other person to edit. And these days, I don't
use any particular software for documents. There are so many - different doc softwares in
Mac that's native, different doc softwares in Windows - especially the famous one - Microsoft Office and it's
ecosystem of softwares. Linux has it's own ecosystem of open source softwares, the famous one
is - Libre Office / Open Office. One thing to note is, it's best if one can use cross platform
softwares. Microsoft Office has softwares that work on Mac and even mobiles. Not sure about Linux.

I think the best thing to do is - go with cloud softwares. No need to install anything. For example
the famous Google Docs and ecosystem. Use it to edit stuff and share stuff too. And it works for everyone the same
way and they just need a browser. They can be on any platform. Google Docs ecosystem also has
native mobile apps for almost all it's softwares.
