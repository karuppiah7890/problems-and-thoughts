# Tagging and Mentions

I have used quite some social media apps.
Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp and long ago
I used to use Facebook too. A lot of these
have the concept of tagging or mentioning
someone - basically referring to someone.
Reasons could be - you want to refer to
the exact person you are talking about
and want to give a link to reach them/
their profile and know them, and instead
of giving URL links this is a very subtle
and easy way to refer to the person,
and it also forms a link too, which
when someone clicks or hovers - they
can see information about the particular
user. This is also a way to let your friend
know about something as this sends a
notification to them too usually.
Or just to mention / tag your friend
simply for fun activities :)

Now, how does one implement this
feature? Tagging/Mentioning. So,
my team is creating a mobile app now,
and we have been recently working
on this feature. And I have seen so
many good ideas from my team around
this feature. It was a really good
learning! Many of the learnings can be applied
to web apps for social media too!

So, this is how we started off with the
problem - to start small and simple, we
wanted to define what we wanted to do.
Initially it was a vague idea for me,
but slowly, with conversations, we refined
the problem and the scope of the first
thing we were going to build.

We had multiple questions. Like, when we
build this feature - how will the user
know that the feature exists? As it didn't
exist till now, and how do we create
awareness? And based on statistics, they found
that people were already using the character "@"
in the content in social media - which is comments
and posts. So, it was clear that people used "@"
by intuition - as many platforms support it.
