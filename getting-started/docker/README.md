# Docker

When I started out, I learned Docker from a small set of YouTube tutorials. The
theory didn't make too much sense but it was good and I liked the practical
stuff that it taught me.

Today it's way more easier to install Docker in any platform and get started
with it. So, go ahead and install it first! https://docker.com

You can checkout the YouTube tutorials to get started. Or Docker website now
has good getting started stuff - tutorials and also an online playground.
Go here

https://www.docker.com/get-started
https://www.docker.com/play-with-docker

You will find tutorials https://www.docker.com/101-tutorial

Online playground https://labs.play-with-docker.com/ , so that you don't even
need to install Docker in your machine to get started. But I would still
recommend installing it in your local as soon as possible :)

And there are also some resources they provide which are free or paid

https://docs.docker.com/get-started/resources/

Another online playground to try out Docker stuff is

https://katacoda.com

You can check all container stuff here

https://katacoda.com/courses/container-runtimes

Docker is actually one tool to help you with what's called containers, and
the concept of containerization.

Once you learn some hands on with Docker, I would recommend learning about the
problems that Docker solves, which will help with "Why use Docker? When to use
Docker?" or more general things like "Why use Containers? When to use
Containers?". And also learn the problems with Docker/Containers.

And then learn about "What happens under the hood in Docker or any Container
runtime?". I checked out this video to understand that -

"GOTO 2018 • Containers From Scratch • Liz Rice"

The above is all assuming you want kind of like an all rounder in the basics
or advanced stuff in Docker or Containers. Like any other technology,
Docker / Containers are a big ocean by themselves. So, I would recommend having
goals and achieving them one by one, to help you understand your milestones and
not get stuck with too much exploration. 

Especially if you have some specific goals like "I want to run my application
inside a container", then you can learn according to that. There are many
tutorials in YouTube and in Katacoda to help you with such stuff :)
