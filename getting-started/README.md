# Getting Started

Getting started with some technology is not always easy, and even if it is, it
takes time to progress and it's hard to measure progress. No wonder there are
so many online courses out there to help you with a learning path and also help
you understand the level at which you are in, for example - novice/beginner,
intermediate, advanced and sorts.

I'm going to be sharing some of the resources that I have used or seen a bit
for learning some stuff. But of course, Your Mileage May Vary (YMMV). Everyone
has their own learning methods and what works for them. For some books work,
for some hands-on, for some youtube videos, for some online courses with quizes
etc. 

I usually learn from multiple mediums - articles, youtube videos, and source
code and also from research papers recently. I don't use books so much, or
online courses, especially paid ones. I guess I'm just too averted to paying for
courses. Also, it's sometimes hard for me to commit to things. So, even if I pay,
it doesn't mean I'll check it out and learn really. It's similar to the tons of
books I have. Some I bought with my own money, some with company money. It
doesn't make much of differnce for me. But some people say - when you get
something for free, you don't value it, but when you get something for money,
you value it. It really depends for me. I guess I have learned that I get fads,
and then they go away. So, investments on the fad also get wasted. For example,
I was planning to learn AR/VR. Thankfully I didn't buy a phone for myself to
change my phone which doesn't support standard AR/VR stuff at the OS level
libraries because of the phone model and features. But I did get my mom a smart
phone to upgrade her old phone, and I made sure it had AR/VR support, so that I
can learn with it. And lol, I didn't touch much of AR/VR later. Unfortunate. But
the reality. I had thoughts about hardware devices too similarly. Like STM32
devices and I got one. Not very costly, but after making it blink lights I didn't
touch it much, just once more to make the lights blink. I had plans to buy a
raspberry pi. Lol. I didn't good. And good for me.

I would surely recommend to wait on your fad to learn stuff and use free stuff
to learn first and not invest too much money in the start itself. Internet is
full of free knowledge in multiple forms - blogs, articles, videos.

So, please learn using some free resources first. Wouldn't recommend jumping
into paid courses, paid bootcamps and paid certifications in the beginning!
Usually a lot of these cost a lot and you might have to weigh in the value they
bring in and if you really want to get started in that path, where the initial
investment is a lot. It will probably get you serious, yes, because you will
be paying, a lot. But is it worth it, especially in the start? is the question
I want you to ask yourself! :) Same for paid books!
