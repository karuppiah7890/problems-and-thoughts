# Golang

Let me start off by saying that Golang is a very simple language, in terms of
learning how to use the basics of the language to be productive. Learning the
internals may take time, and might be a bit steep, as with any programming
language or technology.

If you have already learned a programming language, then it's usually pretty
easy to get started with Golang. Like in my case, I had learned C, C++, Java,
JavaScript a bit, before getting started with Golang.

I installed Golang in my local. I used the official Golang tour to learn some
basic stuff

https://tour.golang.org/

And then I used Go By Example to learn from small snippets of code and to
also refer to it sometimes, when I'm looking for how to do something

https://gobyexample.com/

It has some good examples, if not many.

Another resource I noticed was Golangbot. I noticed it was pretty extensive and
had some kind of path way. I didn't use it much really, but I liked the table
of contents I noticed there. I referred to it just once to check it out

https://golangbot.com/

I have also watched a few videos from Just For Func YouTube channel.
Like 2 or 3. But it does have a lot of content!

People also read a lot of books. Long long ago, I remember reading one book,
a lot. But unfortunately I was only reading, I didn't apply or try the stuff
in the book. I was trying to understand some web development in Golang.
I learned some theories from it, but later forgot. Ideally I would recommend
tons of hands on. I didn't do it probably because of my bad motivation factor.
You can check a lot books from here

I read the `Go Web Programming` book.

Of course the above is all randomly learning some stuff in Golang, without goals.
Which is why I would recommend thinking about - "Do I have a goal for learning
Golang?"

If you simply want to check it out and don't have any goals for now. Try out
some of the above resources randomly, starting with the golang tour.

But if you have specific goals, I would recommend that you tackle the goals
head first and learn based on the goal. More like backtrack from the goal.

If the goal is to create a backend service, start saying "Okay, I'm going to
create a HTTP backend service" which will lead to asking "How to create a 
web service in Golang?" and so on. You will slowly learn the language too.
If you think that's too much, just go through the Golang Tour first, if you
already know some languages. Then move on to this, and it will surely be easy
and will also help you achieve your goals while learning on the Go ;)

Golang's package management is based on Golang Modules. You need to learn
the basics of that too, to work with libraries other than the standard
libraries.

That's all I had. And by the way, Golang is used in a lot of domains. You can
check more in the https://go.dev/ site !

Some of the domains I know are - web development, desktop apps, mobile app
modules, tiny machines like STM32 ([tinygo](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo)),
robots ([gobot](https://gobot.io/)), computer vision ([gocv](https://gocv.io/)),
ML and more! 

Golang may not be the most famous or efficient languages to work with in all
these domains. But all the authors of the libraries and softwares in these
domains are working hard to make the software better and easy to use. And if
there's one thing that Golang is known for, it's simplicity. Followed by being
fast and also avoiding unnecessary discussions about opinions on "how to format
code? how to lint code?", for which standard tools are there, and many high
level tools too, to enrich your software development with Golang :D
