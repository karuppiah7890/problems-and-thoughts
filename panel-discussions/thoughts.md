# Panel Discussions

I need to conduct a panel discussion for an event. So, I'm doing my research on
it!

The first thing I was reading was this :P

Some questions to ask ourselves, that is, the organizers
1. What's the objective of this panel discussion? What will be the take aways
for everyone - panelists, moderator and the audience? Especially the audience?
2. How much time are we planning to conduct the discussion for?
3. In person panel discussion or online (remote) over Internet call (like zoom)?
4. How to decide a topic?

Deciding a topic, some ways
1. We can think of some trending things in the industry, we need a way to do
that though, but once we know that, we get the top 4 or 5 of them and we start
off a public poll and see what the audience thinks looking at the total
number of people who responded to the poll and what percentage of people think
which topic is good. 

Pros of this would be - audience decides the topic to some extent. It might
bring in more people as the topic is based on what the audience like.

Cons of this would be - very less audience could be taking part in the poll and
a lot more than that might be attending the panel discussion and it's also
possible that a lot of the people who took part in the poll may not even attend
the panel discussion but are still controlling a large part of it. And if we
don't do enough awareness on the poll, and if many eyes don't see it, we will
not get very diverse opinions on what people like, and hence very less people
will be taking part in the poll, as mentioned. Also, people who chose other
topics in the poll, may not attend since their topic was not chosen; very
possible thing.

2. Another way would be to, choose a topic ourselves. May be have an internal
poll within the company and see what people think! We still need a list of
topics to choose from.

3. Idea: Discuss with people who know marketing well and see how such stuff is
handled.
